Problem Statement

The objective is to predict customer churn, a critical metric indicating the percentage of customers who stop purchasing or interacting with a business. High churn rates can adversely affect business growth, making it essential to accurately predict and address customer attrition.

Business Use Cases

Customer churn is vital for businesses to measure and understand for improving customer retention. This model aids in identifying at-risk customers, enabling businesses to implement strategies to retain them.

Approach

Data Reading: Load the dataset.
EDA: Perform detailed EDA on numeric and categorical columns.
Preprocessing: Conduct data preprocessing and feature engineering.
Model Training: Split the data, train a basic model, and perform hyperparameter tuning.
Feature Selection: Identify the best features from the training data.
Model Metrics: Calculate precision, recall, accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
Results

Model metrics including precision, recall, accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix are provided to evaluate the model's performance.
